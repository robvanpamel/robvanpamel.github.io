## .NET Software Architect

I am a Belgian .NET consultant with a focus on architecture and cloud, working at Axxes IT Consultancy.  

I started to work as a .NET consultant in 2007 in a world with many Winform- and console applications. Soon I got attracted by the web and my career evolved into that direction more and more. When cloud computing arise I could not resist jumping on that train and that train is still moving ahead.

As a consultant, I see many things. Some things might look the same, but they are not. That is what I like about it, getting out of the comfort zone and learning something new every day! Recently I discovered that I like to spread the knowledge as well. This is why I started to speak at conferences and now recently started to blog as well. 

For those who don't know me, I am a coffee addict. So if you like what you see here: feel free to support me and buy me a coffee, it is highly appreciated!
