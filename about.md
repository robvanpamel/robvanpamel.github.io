I am a .NET consultant with a focus on architecture and cloud. 

I started to work as a .NET consultant in 2007 in a world with many Winform- and console applications. Soon I got attracted by the web and my career evolved into that direction more and more. When cloud computing arise I could not resist jumping on that train and that train is still moving ahead.

As a consultant, I see many things. Some things might look the same, but they are not. That is what I like about it, getting out of the comfort zone and learning something new every day!
