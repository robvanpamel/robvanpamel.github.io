# Talks 
## No. I don't need servers for .NET in AWS. 
_Serverless is a hot topic, and for most .NET developers, that means they instinctively look at Microsoft Azure. But what does that mean for our architecture?_

_In this session I will show how to set up an application architecture, using C#, for serverless on AWS. I'll touch on topics like serverless Compute, Databases and serverless Identity Management._

_You will learn more how to build a reactive serverless application and how it affects your database design_

## Microsoft .NET on AWS: Looking over the hedge
_Microsoft .NET code blends perfectly with Microsoft Azure. But isn’t Amazon AWS the biggest cloud provider? Why wouldn’t we use the AWS cloud to host our application, is it possible to do?_

_During this session, we will demonstrate which possibilities we have in AWS to host a web application from top to bottom._

_At the end of the session you will have an overview of some AWS services which can be used to host your own .NET web application using serverless techniques based on .NET CORE with MSSQL & NOSQL database._
