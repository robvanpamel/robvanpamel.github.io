I am always eager to share my knowledge and It can't be done in a better way than when speaking about it. You can track me on sessionize ([https://sessionize.com/rob-van-pamel/](https://sessionize.com/rob-van-pamel/)) or take a look below. 

# Talks 
## What a modern mailman should know delivering messages.
_So many messaging technologies, it might blow your mind: EventBridge, AMQP, Saga’s, SQS, Amazon MQ, MassTransit, NServiceBus, Rebus, Brighter, outbox, …
All of them have 1 thing in common: they deliver a message!_

_During this talk I take a deep dive into asynchronous messaging. What are these technologies for, and how do they stack up to each other? Do you actually need any of these technologies, and when do you use which one? Which patterns should and shouldn’t you use with messaging?

I will guide you through the current ‘messaging landscape’ so you have a good understanding of the technologies and patterns, and you know when to apply each one.

## No. I don't need servers for .NET in AWS. 
_Serverless is a hot topic, and for most .NET developers, that means they instinctively look at Microsoft Azure. But what does that mean for our architecture?_

_In this session I will show how to set up an application architecture, using C#, for serverless on AWS. I'll touch on topics like serverless Compute, Databases and serverless Identity Management._

_You will learn more how to build a reactive serverless application and how it affects your database design_

## Microsoft .NET on AWS: Looking over the hedge
_Microsoft .NET code blends perfectly with Microsoft Azure. But isn’t Amazon AWS the biggest cloud provider? Why wouldn’t we use the AWS cloud to host our application, is it possible to do?_

_During this session, we will demonstrate which possibilities we have in AWS to host a web application from top to bottom._

_At the end of the session you will have an overview of some AWS services which can be used to host your own .NET web application using serverless techniques based on .NET CORE with MSSQL & NOSQL database._
